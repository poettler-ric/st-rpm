# Motivation
The original package copied config.h into `/usr/src` which then interfered with
st-user configurations where patches altered `config.def.h`.

# Origin
This is a fork of Fedora's [st](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/st) package.

# Packages
RPMs can be found
[here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/poettlerric/st/).
